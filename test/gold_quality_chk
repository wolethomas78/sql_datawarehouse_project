Quality Checks
Script Purpose
	This script performs quality checks to validate the integrity, consistency and accuracy of the Gold layer.
         These checks ensure:
	- Uniqueness of surrogate key in dimension tables.
	- Referential integrity between fact and dimensiontables.
	- Validation of relationships in the data model for analytical purposes.
Usage:
	- Run these checks after data loading silver layer.
	- Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the check
